# Elasticsearch

## What is Elasticsearch

Elasticsearch is a open-source search and analytics engine. It can quickly search through massive amounts of text data.  Its primary strength is finding relevant documents based on complex queries.



## Concept

- **Document:** A json object contains business data(product description, log message, blog, ...)
- **Index:** A collection of documents that have similar characteristics. Similar to "table" in RDBMS.

- **Shard**: Elasticsearch subdivides an index into multiple pieces called shards.
