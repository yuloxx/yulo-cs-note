## 📘 Purpose of This Repository

The goals of this repository are:

* To document and organize **common computer science knowledge**, including operating systems, networks, databases, algorithms, and more.
* To record **practical engineering experience** from real-world development and production environments.
* To provide a clean and searchable **technical note system** for long-term reference.
* To build a **static documentation site** using MkDocs for easier browsing and navigation.

## 🛠️ Build with MkDocs

This project uses **MkDocs** to generate the documentation website.

### 1. Install Python

Ensure Python 3.x is installed:

```bash
python --version
```

### 2. Install MkDocs

Install MkDocs via pip:

```bash
pip install mkdocs
```

### 3. Navigate to the Project Directory

Change to the folder containing `mkdocs.yml`:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
```

### 4. Start the Local Server

Run:

```bash
mkdocs serve
```

### 5. Open the Documentation

Open the local URL displayed in the terminal, usually:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```

Your documentation site will now be available locally.
